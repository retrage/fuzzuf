// In the following section, we define the probability distribution for the
// havoc mutation. The definition consists of the following two steps:
//   1. initialize the weights that represent
//      the probabilities of each case being selected in Havoc.
//   2. initialize discrete_distribution with the weights.
//
// The problem here is that the weights should be changed depending on whether
// AFL has extras and auto extras(constant strings included in the
// dictionaries). Therefore, we need to define 4 sets of weights, each of which
// represents the probabilities in the case where AFL has {some, no} extras and
// {some, no} auto extras.
//
// Also, right below, we use constexpr and static variables a lot.
// AFL doesn't modify the weights and distributions dynamically,
// so we don't want to initialize them more than once.
// This is why the following functions use constexpr and are a little bit hard
// to read.
